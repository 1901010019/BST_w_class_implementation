This is a modification of the code from youtube channel "mycodeschool"'s video entitled "Binary Search Tree- Implementation in C/C++." 

I saw in the comment section of the video that many people wanted to see how to implement this using classes in C++, rather than having 
all of the code in one file.

I've written all of the implementation except for the delete function, which you can do as an exercise. 
I also ran out of time to write the destructor for BST; I will add that in when I get the opportunity to do so, otherwise feel free to 
work on it yourself. 

Please note that I'm not affiliated with "mycodeschool," its founders or employees in any way nor do I claim any rights or contributions
to any of their material.

Have fun with BSTs!
